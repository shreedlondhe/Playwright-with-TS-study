1)What is Test Isolation in Playwright?
Answer:
Test isolation in Playwright means every test runs in a fresh browser context with its own cookies, localStorage, and session, ensuring tests do not interfere with each other.
No shared cookies 
[Cookies = small data sent with every HTTP request,Stored by browser,Automatically sent to server,Used for authentication & sessions,Have expiry
Use : Login session,Auth tokens]
No shared local storage
[LocalStorage = browser-side storage only,Stores data as key–value pairs,Not sent to server,No expiry (until cleared),Accessible via JavaScript]
No shared cache
[Cache = stored website resources,Stores static files,Improves page load speed,]

2)How Playwright Achieves Test Isolation
Answer:
By default, Playwright Test:
Launches one Browser
Creates a new BrowserContext per test
Creates a new Page per test

3) What is Playwright?
Answer:
Playwright is an end-to-end automation framework by Microsoft used to test web applications.
It supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API.

4) Why Playwright over Selenium?
Answer:
Auto-waiting (no need for explicit waits),support Video recording.
Faster execution
Supports multiple browsers & tabs
Better handling of modern web apps (SPA)
Built-in test runner

5) Why TypeScript is preferred with Playwright?
Answer:
Compile-time error checking
Strong typing (Locator, Page, Browser)
Better IDE support (auto-complete)
Fewer runtime errors

6) Difference between page ,context and  browser?
Answer:
Browser = actual browser instance [Examples: Chromium, Chrome, Firefox, WebKit]
BrowserContext = isolated user session [Like an Incognito window]
Page = a single tab

7) Real Playwright Test Example
Answer:
test('browser vs context vs page', async ({ browser }) => {
  const context = await browser.newContext();
  const page = await context.newPage();

  await page.goto('https://example.com');
});

8) Why does Playwright use BrowserContext instead of launching a new browser for every test?
Answer:
Launching a browser is expensive and slow.
BrowserContext provides a lightweight, isolated session (like incognito) that gives test isolation without restarting the browser, making tests faster and more scalable.

9) Can two pages share cookies?
Answer:
✅ Yes, if they belong to the same BrowserContext
❌ No, if they belong to different BrowserContexts

10) Can two BrowserContexts share data?
Answer:
❌ No.
Each BrowserContext is fully isolated — cookies, localStorage, cache are not shared.

11) How do you handle multiple tabs in Playwright?
Answer:
const pages = context.pages();
const secondTab = pages[1];
await secondTab.bringToFront();

12) Difference between browser.newPage() and context.newPage()?
Answer:
_________________________________________________________________
| Method              | Result                                   |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `browser.newPage()` | Creates **new context + page**           |
| `context.newPage()` | Creates **page inside existing context** |
------------------------------------------------------------------

13) How does Playwright achieve test isolation?
Answer:
By creating a new BrowserContext per test, Playwright ensures:
Clean cookies
No shared localStorage
Reliable parallel execution

14) Can you run tests in parallel using one browser?
Answer:
✅ Yes.
One browser → multiple contexts → parallel tests.

15) How do you wait for an element to be visible?
Answer:
await page.locator('#login').waitFor({ state: 'visible' });

16) How do you handle alerts / dialogs?
Answer:
page.on('dialog', async dialog => {
  console.log(dialog.message());
  await dialog.accept(); // or dialog.dismiss()
});

17) How do you upload a file?
Answer:
await page.setInputFiles('#upload', 'tests/data/file.pdf');

18) How do you take a screenshot?
Answer:
await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png', fullPage: true });

19) How do you handle frames (iframe)?
Answer:
const frame = page.frameLocator('#frameId');
await frame.locator('#btn').click();

20) How do you mock API response?
Answer:
await page.route('**/api/users', route =>
  route.fulfill({
    status: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ name: 'Shrinivas' })
  })
);

21) What is test.use()?
Answer:
Used to apply settings per test or per file
test.use({ browserName: 'chromium' });

22) Difference between Locator and ElementHandle?
Answer:
Locator	                       ElementHandle
Auto-wait	                  ❌ No auto-wait
Recommended	              ❌ Not recommended
Lazy evaluation	              Immediate

23) How do you get text from element?
Answer:
const text = await page.locator('#msg').textContent();

24) Common assertions for elements
Answer:
await expect(locator).toBeVisible();
await expect(locator).toBeEnabled();
await expect(locator).toBeChecked();
await expect(locator).toHaveText('Login');

25) How to take screenshots on failure?
Answer:
Configured in playwright.config.ts
use: {
  screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
}

26)What are fixtures in Playwright?
Definition:
A fixture in Playwright is a pre-configured resource that is automatically created before a test and cleaned up after the test.
Key points:
            Helps reuse setup code.
            Ensures test isolation (each test gets its own instance).
            Supports automatic cleanup
Playwright comes with several built-in fixtures that you can use directly in your tests: page,browser,browserContext,request,workInfo

27)What are locators in Playwright?
Answer:
In Playwright, locators are a powerful way to identify and interact with elements on a web page.
const element =await page.locator(selector);

28)Explain the difference between locator.click() and page.click()?
Answer:
Use locator.click() instead of page.click() because locators provide better auto-waiting, retry logic, and stability for modern dynamic web applications.
locator.click()->first declare locator and then click (auto-waits, retries, and handles dynamic DOM)
page.click()->passing locator while clicking (is a one-time action and can be flaky)

29) How do you launch a browser in Playwright?
Answer:
const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });

30) What is auto-waiting in Playwright?
Answer:
Playwright automatically waits for:
Element to appear
Visibility
Enablement
Stability

31)What is test.describe()?
Answer:
Used to group related test cases.
test.describe('Login Tests', () => {
  test('valid login', async () => {});
});

32)What is expect in Playwright?

Answer:
expect is an assertion library used to validate test results.

await expect(page).toHaveTitle('Home');

33)What is beforeEach and afterEach?
Answer:
beforeEach runs before every test
afterEach runs after every test

34)What is BrowserContext? Why is it important?
Answer:
BrowserContext is an isolated browser session similar to an incognito window.
Importance:
Separate cookies & cache
Enables parallel execution
Improves security testing

35)How do you handle file upload?
Answer:
await page.setInputFiles('#upload', 'file.pdf');

36)What is an ElementHandle in Playwright?
Answer:
In Playwright, an ElementHandle is a reference (handle) to a specific DOM element on the page.
It represents one particular element at a specific point in time.
const elementHandle = await page.$('#username'); // page.$('#username') returns an ElementHandle
await elementHandle?.fill('Shrinivas');

40)Difference between Locator and ElementHandle?
Answer:
Locator	      ElementHandle
Auto-waits	❌ No
Retry logic	❌ No
DOM-safe	❌ No
Recommended	❌ No

Answer:
await page.route('**/api/**', route =>
  route.fulfill({ status: 200, body: JSON.stringify(mockData) })
);
